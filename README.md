# Physical Computing With Scratch

**This project has been archived and is no longer maintained**

The version of Scratch included with the Raspberry Pi has a number of unique features; one of the most useful is its ability to communicate with the General-Purpose Input/Output pins, or GPIO. These pins allow you to connect your Raspberry Pi to a range of devices, from lights and motors to buttons and sensors. The Raspberry Pi 2 has 40 GPIO pins, whilst the original Raspberry Pi only has 26, but this workshop will work with either model.
