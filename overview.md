The version of Scratch included with the Raspberry Pi has a number of unique features; one of the most useful is its ability to communicate with the General-Purpose Input-Output pins, or GPIO. These pins allow you to connect your Raspberry Pi to a range of devices, from lights and motors to buttons and sensors. The Raspberry Pi 2 has 40 pins (of which there are 26 GPIO pins), whilst the original Raspberry Pi only has 26 pins (of which there are 17 GPIO pins), but this workshop will work with either model.
