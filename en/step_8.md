## What next?

- Why not have a go at some of our other [physical computing projects using Scratch](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects?software%5B%5D=scratch&hardware%5B%5D=electronic-components)
- Or maybe have a play with the [SenseHAT using Scratch](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects?software%5B%5D=scratch&hardware%5B%5D=sense-hat)
